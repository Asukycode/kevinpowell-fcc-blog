                        <b>I used to be a pack rat. </b>loved, but the truth was I
                        couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.

                        Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I
                        couldn't
                        hold a relationship.

                        <b>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</b> I literally put
                        90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I
                        quit my job.

                    <p class="post-content">
                        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else
                        to do. And it worked.

                        Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less
                        stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.

                        With how much it turned my life around, <b>I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I
                            did it,</b> and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started
